This assignment is made using Next.js (A React Framework).

# What this project do:

1. In this project, you can see a list of users fetched from an api & you can select any user from the list to see their location on a map.

2. A form is made available to the website user to submit a name and title to an api. The submission of data will be sent through a post request.

# How to run this project:

1. Clone or Download this project on your PC.
2. Open the directory '/coding-challenge-frontend' in your code editor or terminal.
3. Run this project by using command 'npm start' (without quotes)
4. Open localhost:3000 on your browser to use the site.

# This project works this way:

1. On selecting a user and clicking on "View on map" button will show the location of the user on a map. Here the selection of a user is required, otherwise an error alert will show up.

2. In the form below, there are two input fields which are required to be filled before submission of form. If any of the field is not filled, an error alert will show up.

3. If the form is filled correctly, on submittion of form, a post request is sent to an api (which can be seen in the browser console). In case there is an error connecting to the api, an error alert will show up.

# Assignment Completion:

All the tasks of assignment are done except e2e testing task.
The reason is that I have not yet studied about testing of components. But I will try my best to learn about unit testing as soon as possible.

# On a personal note:

Thanks a lot for sending this task. It was a really good experience for me.
