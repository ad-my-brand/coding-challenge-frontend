This React.js application is a dynamic blend of form controls and an integrated map feature. Upon the initial form load, data is dynamically fetched from a provided URL, and geocoordinates are dynamically visualized on the map, offering users a real-time view. Users can then effortlessly populate the form with accurate details, and in the event of any errors, a customized error message promptly appears, guiding users towards accurate submissions. Upon submitting the form, the application sends the data to the designated URL and patiently awaits a response. Based on this response, it dynamically generates success or error alerts, ensuring a seamless and user-friendly experience.
